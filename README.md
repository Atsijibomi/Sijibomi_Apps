I've developed a user-friendly web application called the 'URL Shortener Web App.' This project revolves around simplifying long URLs into short, shareable links. By using this app, you can quickly convert complex web addresses into concise links that are easy to share on social media, messaging platforms, and more. When you use the app, it provides me with a user-friendly interface where you can input a lengthy URL, and in return, I generate a shortened link for you. Additionally, I offer insight into the performance of each short link, including the number of clicks it has received. So, let me help you manage and efficiently share URLs.
